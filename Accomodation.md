# Accommodation in Tokyo
Ryokan, hotels and hostels. Tokyo leaves you spoilt for choice when it comes to accomodation for your trip. In this chapter I'll briefely explain the different types of accommodation and give an overview of the main areas of Tokyo to help you decide where to stay.

## Types of Accommodation
### Ryokan 
These are traditional style Japanese inns and are famous across the world for their hospitality. Ryokan are often family run and have been open for many years. Ryokan have tatami matting throughout so you will need to take your shoes off and where the provoded slippers upon entry. The rooms are usually large open spaces with sliding door cupboards. During the day the room will be occupied by a low table where you can eat your meals and then while you're out and about the staff will swap it for futons stored in the cupboard. In some more budget ryokan you will need to set out your futon yourself and will have a small kitchenette for self catering. At the other end of the scale some ryokan will even have their own private onsen (Japanese hotsprings).

I personally haven't stayed in a ryokan but my main tip would be to research what your ryokan is famous for and book in advance as there are often only a few rooms and those with onsens or special quirks tend to fill up fast.


### Hotels
Fancy staying in a hotel where all the staff are robots? Japan has got you covered. Want to be terrorised by Godzilla every time you look out of you window? Japan has got you covered. Love Hello Kitty so much you want to sleep surrounded by her? Japan has got your covered.

If you're just looking for a more "normal" hotel don't worry there are plenty of those too that can suit a range of budgets. As usual with Japan the service in all hotels is top notch and the staff will do whatever they can to help you enjoy your stay. Hotels in Japan are pretty much the same as everywhere else (apart from the awesome themes) so I won't go  into much detail. Usually I don't bother with hotels so that I can afford even more anime.

### Hostels
The budget traveller's best friend. Usually I stay in hostels with friends or even with my mum. Japanese hostels are so far the nicest I've stayed in. The rooms are all clean, the communal areas inviting and the multilingual staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Like most hostels the rooms are often bunk beds with individual bed lights and shared bathrooms. A lot of the hostels I've been to don't look like much on the outside but once you get in they're very clean and usually quite modern. Most places have free wifi and the staff will be happy to give you recommendations for the local area.

okamiNinja's Top Recommendation: The Khaosan Chain
 I would highly recommend staying in one of their private rooms. I've stayed in 2 different hostels with them - Kabuki & Origami. Orgiami was much newer and had really nice bathrooms (although we did have to share). I think their best one for private rooms is called Laboratory and each room is unique. Here's a link to their website as they put plenty of pictures here: http://khaosan-tokyo.com/en/ But I would advise booking through hostelworld.com as their website is better. The staff at these hostels are always super nice and they give you a map of Asakusa with recommendations. There's free wifi and computers for you to use.
